<div align='center'> <h1> Homeworks </h1>

This folder contains all the homework projects assigned my my professor to assess our knowledge of the material presented that week. 
  
These were relatively short and simple assignments.
 
Each folder describes a different assignment for a different topic and will display the description as well as the grade of the project. The purpose of this is to be show transparency of both my strengths and shortcomings across each assignment.
