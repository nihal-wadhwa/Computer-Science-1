<div align='center'> <h1> Lab 3: Zigzag</h1>

### Description:
  
We were tasked to write a program that draws figures like the picture shown below using recursion. When run, the program will prompt for the recursion depth, and then draw the figure so that it fits in the standard canvas window. We were to assume that depth will always be non-negative. There are two programs, one, named zigzagBW.py which will draw the zigzags in grayscale and the other, named zigzag.py, which will draw the zigzags alternating in color.
